## Vex Landing Page

### Objective
Create a landing page as designed by someone else.

In this instance, the design is a desktop design by [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com). **Note:**_Some obvious spelling errors, etc. were corrected that the designer had in the .sketch file included in this repo._

My personal goals for this project to push my skills to the next level include:

- [x] Write a node.js file that automatically builds my initial file structure. 
  - index.html file, asset folders, css folders and file, js folders and file, readme.md file, and .gitignore file.
- [ ] Use build tools (Gulp and Webpack) to 
  - [x] Automate browser refresh on html change
  - [ ] Automate browser refresh on javascript change
  - [x] Inject CSS
  - [x] Compile SCSS and convert to CSS 
  - [ ] Bundle JavaScript (webpack) 
  - [ ] Build production minified production code
- [ ] Design and Develop mobile version based on desktop design
_Designer did not provide a mobile version, which is why I intentionally chose this file as I wanted to develop a responsive mobile version myself._
- [ ] Use SVG icons and automatically build a sprite for them.
_I will be opting get icons from another source as they were not supplied in the sketch file, and I don't want to use bootstrap icons._
